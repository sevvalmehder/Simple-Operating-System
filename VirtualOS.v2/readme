Some notes about HW02

This files are changed and new files. Program must compile with the given files
in version 1.

All asm files task explained the beginning of .asm files.

Thread switching is controlled with Round-robin(RR) scheduler
(quantum time = 100 cycles)

Added System Calls:

	- TCreate - [Reg A = 11](80 cycle) : It works like the pthread_create call 
	of UNIX systems. It returns the thread ID in register B on success. On fail,
	returns 0. After this call, a new thread is created and it starts running 
	the function passed as parameter.
	- TExit - [Reg A = 8](50 cycle) :It works like the pthread_exit call of 
	UNIX systems. It terminates the calling thread.
	- TJoin - [Reg A = 9](40 cycle) : Blocks the calling thread until the thread
	with thread ID is terminated.
	- TYield - [Reg A = 10](40 cycle) : Causes the calling thread to yield the 
	CPU. The thread is placed at the end of the schedule queue.
	
Added debug mode features:

	- In Debug mode 2 : Every time a thread switch happens,thread ID of both 
	threads and total cycles spent for the blocked thread are printed to the 
	screen.
	- Debug mode 3 :  Information about each thread is printed on the screen 
	when a thread switch occurs.
